# k8s-in-one-shot

A hands-on learning project to understand Kubernetes fundamentals in one go.

This repository focuses on the core Kubernetes workflow using KIND (Kubernetes in Docker), covering:
- Local Kubernetes cluster setup
- Containerized application deployment
- Pods, Deployments, and Services
- Service exposure and access
- Basic Kubernetes best practices

The goal is learning by doing — keeping things simple, practical, and close to real-world Kubernetes usage.
